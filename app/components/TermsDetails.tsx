            when a driving license is not in English. The hirer is solely responsible to ensure that their 
            license is valid for use in the respective country and to determine whether an International 
            Driving Permit is required by local law. Failure to provide a valid licence and IDP permit

The period until the funds are released is usually between 5 and 15 days but can be longer depending on the type of card and country of issue.<br/>

          <p><b>Auto Insurance Requirements</b><br/>
          Customers intending to self-insure our vehicles are required to produce sufficient proof of auto insurance, to include comprehensive and collision deductibles. 
          If opting to self-insure, you must carry a full coverage policy, to include both physical damage and liability.<br/>If opting to utilize credit card CDW, please note 
          liability is not covered by credit cards, and the guest must purchase SLI from the rental counter. Insurance verification must be presented in the form of documentation 
          (declaration page of policy), email or via the insurance company’s mobile application only. If proof of insurance cannot be provided, clients will be able to purchase insurance at the counter.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><b>Collision Damage Waiver (CDW):</b><br/>
            This is not an insurance and is an optional product available for purchase at the time of rental. In most states, 
            in the event of any other loss or damage to the car, regardless of fault, your financial responsibility extends to the full value of the car at the time of rental, 
            less its salvage value, plus expenses for towing, storage impound fees, an administrative fee and a reasonable charge for loss of use. 
            If a Debit card or cash is allowed at the rental counter for the security deposit, the purchase of our CDW plan will be mandatory. 
            (This description is for informational purposes only. Please refer to the materials provided at the time of rental for specific policy provisions and exclusions).<br/>

          <p><b>Supplemental Liability Insurance (SLI)</b><br/>
            This is available for an additional daily charge for each rental day. SLI is a secondary insurance product that picks up where primary liability (state statutory limits) leaves off. 
            When combined with primary liability coverage, SLI provides the renter and any authorized driver up to 1,000,000 USD of liability protection for third party claims due to bodily injury or property damage. 
            In order for SLI to pay on a claim, however, the state statutory limits must first at least be satisfied. The policy will respond only after all other available insurance has been exhausted. 
            The purchase of SLI will be required if renter does not own a vehicle or auto insurance policy in their name. If insuring your rental car with a credit card which has rental car benefits, 
            the purchase of SLI will be required, unless renter has proof of liability auto insurance which must be presented at the time of pickup. *Car hire does not take insurance from Canada or Puerto Rico. 
            *There is some restrictions on the insurance please contact car rental for details

          is the responsibility of the hirer until the rental agents have checked in the vehicle. In keeping with industry standards and association guidelines, short term vehicle rental does not have 
          a margin of fair wear and tear for damage. A short term rental is any hire for which the duration is less than 90 consecutive days. Any change to the condition of the vehicle during the rental will be the responsibility of the customer.</p>
